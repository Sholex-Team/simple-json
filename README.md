<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
All you need to do is installing the Simple JSON as a shared library or use it directly as a sub-project in your CMake
project.
### Prerequisites

There isn't much here, install CMake and you are good to go !
* CMake >= 3.16

2. Install the binary using a package manager
   ```sh
   sudo dpkg -i simple_json-1.0.0.deb
   ```
3. Add the shared library to your project
   ```cmake
   find_package(simple_json 1.0.0 REQUIRED)
   
   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} simple_json)
   ```

### Installing using CMake
