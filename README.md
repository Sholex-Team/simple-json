<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Nothing special, a simple, fast and small JSON library with many interesting features.

Here are some features :
- **There is NO Dependency !**
  

- **STL-like data access and usage**
  

- **Memory efficiency** : Each JSON object has an overhead of one pointer (the maximal size of a union) and one 
  enumeration element (1 byte). 
  The default generalization uses the following C++ data 
  types: `std::string` for strings, `long int` or `double` for numbers, `std::map` for objects, `std::vector`
  for arrays, and `bool` for Booleans. 
  

- **Intuitive syntax** : We tried our best to provide a first class data type like syntax that makes creating and
using Json objects almost as easy as dictionaries in Python or objects in JS, using
  C++ operator overloading and easy to use methods.

Check out the [Documentation](https://doc.sholexteam.ir/simple-json/) for more information.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
All you need to do is installing the Simple JSON as a shared library or use it directly as a sub-project in your CMake
project.
### Prerequisites

There isn't much here, install CMake and you are good to go !
* CMake >= 3.16

### Installing using package managers

1. Download one of the binary packages ([DEB](https://bin.sholexteam.ir/simple-json/deb/simple_json-1.0.0.deb)
   , [RPM](https://bin.sholexteam.ir/simple-json/rpm/simple_json-1.0.0.rpm))
2. Install the binary using a package manager
   ```sh
   sudo dpkg -i simple_json-1.0.0.deb
   ```
3. Add the shared library to your project
   ```cmake
   find_package(simple_json 1.0.0 REQUIRED)
   
   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} simple_json)
   ```

### Installing using CMake

1. Clone the project
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Sholex-Team/simple-json
   cd simple-json
   ```
2. Create a build directory
   ```shell
   mkdir cmake-build-release
   ```
3. Create cmake build files
   ```shell
   cmake ..
   ```
4. Build and install the project
   ```shell
   cmake --build .
   cmake --install .
   ```

### Using as a CMake sub-project

1. Clone the project inside your project
   ```shell
   cd /path/to/your/projects/third_parties/
   git clone https://github.com/Sholex-Team/simple-json
   ```
2. Add simple-json as a sub-directory in your main `CMakeLists.txt`
   ```cmake
   add_subdirectory(/path/to/your/projects/third_parties/simple-json)
   ```
3. Link the library to your project
   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} simple_json)
   ```
